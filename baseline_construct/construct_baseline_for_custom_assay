Detecting MSI status based on panels other than Burning Rock ColonCore panel, several steps should firstly be performed to establish baseline new panels. 

1) Catalog all homo-polymers in your host genome. Several algorithms available to do this, but one we have incorporated in our package is the MSIsensor(PMID:24371154), which is very easy to use. Microsatellites with long repeat length are recommendated. 
2) Limit the list of microsatellites to those presented in your capture design. Location of BED format is required.
3) Select microsatellite marker loci and construct baseline files. No fewer than 20 neat MSI-H & MSS cell lines or tumor samples with known tumor cell percentage and normal samples are required.
4) Perform bMSISAE analysis of many normal plasma samples to construct the baseline of H values and cutoff of MS scores.
5) Incorporate the results of 4) to baseline data.
